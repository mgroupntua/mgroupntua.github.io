# About
[MGroup](http://mgroup.ntua.gr) is a research lab specialized in computational mechanics problems, situated in the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr), at the school of [Civil Engineering](http://www.civil.ntua.gr/). As part of its research activities, MGroup develops and maintains a series of open-source repos which implement all of its work related to its research activities

MGroup strives to interoperate with academia and the industry, using its open-source activities as both a basis and framework for developing novel algoriths that solve real-world problems efficiently
